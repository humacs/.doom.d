[[file:splash/kubemacs.png]]

This is the humacs Doom Emacs configuration. From this org file, all the necessary Doom Emacs config files are generated.

This file is written in [[https://leanpub.com/lit-config][literate programming style]] using [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. See [[file:init.el][init.el]], [[file:packages.el][packages.el]] and [[file:config.el][config.el]] for the generated files.

It's meant to be a shared base for other humacs users, with a focus on how we pair at ii.

* Sharing and Pairing

It should be useful within [[https://pair.sharing.io][pair.sharing.io]] instances, as a docker/podman container, and on the desktop.

It should also encourage self-exploration / configuration and sharing by copying / customizing config.org as USER.org.

We also have heavy [[https://tmate.io][tmate.io]] integration via our [[file:local/tmate][local/tmate]] code.

* Backstory

Our config started with spacemacs, to which we added a Dockerfile due to the difficulty of creating a stable development environment for our team.

We began to run this container within a shared cluster, until our kubernetes development tasks led of to sometimes interfere with each others pods.

* Humacs Doom config file overview

- =init.el= defines which of the existing Doom [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#modules][modules]] are loaded. A Doom module is a bundle of packages, configuration and commands, organized into a unit that can be toggled easily from this file.
- =packages.el= defines which [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#package-management][packages]] should be installed, beyond those that are installed and loaded as part of the enabled modules.
- =config.el= contains all [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#configuring-doom][custom configuration]] and code.

There are other files that can be loaded, but theses are the main ones. The load order of different files is [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#load-order][defined depending on the type of session]] being started.

All the config files are generated from this Org file, to try and make its meaning as clear as possible. All =package!= declarations are written to =packages.el=, all other LISP code is written to =config.el=.

* Config file headers

We start by simply defining the standard headers used by the three files. These headers come from the initial files generated by =doom install=, and contain either some Emacs-LISP relevant indicators like =lexical-binding=, or instructions about the contents of the file.

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programing source file located at
;; https://gitlab.com/zzamboni/dot-doom/-/blob/master/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.

;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;;(package! another-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;;(package! this-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")

;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
;;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
;;(unpin! t)

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
;; (setq org-directory "~/org/")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
;; (setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

** Customized variables

Doom [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#configure][does not recommend the Emacs =customize= mechanism]]:

#+begin_quote
/Note: do not use M-x customize or the customize API in general. Doom is designed to be configured programmatically from your config.el, which can conflict with Customize’s way of modifying variables./
#+end_quote

All necessary settings are therefore set by hand as part of this configuration file. The only exceptions are "safe variable" and "safe theme" settings, which are automatically saved by Emacs in =custom.el=, but this is OK as they don't conflict with anything else from the config.

* Humacs Human Deets
On a sharing.io cluster, we should have these two env vars set...so we can personalize to the person who started the instance.
Otherwise, they're just a friend.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

#+END_SRC

* Consistency
** consistent paths
If you are using a mac, you can have  problem with running source blocks or some language support as the shell PATH isn't found in emacs. [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]] is a solution for this.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

** Fonts
;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Source Code Pro" :size 10)
      ;; )(font-spec :family "Source Code Pro" :size 8 :weight 'semi-light)
      doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "Source Code Pro" :size 10)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Source Code Pro" :size 10)

#+END_SRC
** LSP Behaviour
This brings over the lsp behaviour of spacemacs, so working with code feels consistent across emacs..
#+NAME: Setup LSP-UI
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package! lsp-ui
:config
          (setq lsp-navigation 'both)
          (setq lsp-ui-doc-enable t)
          (setq lsp-ui-doc-position 'top)

          (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil)
          (setq lsp-print-io t))
#+END_SRC
* Languages
** Web
auto-closing tags works different if you are in a terminal or gui.  We want consistent behaviour when editing any sort of web doc.
I also like it to create a closing tag when i've starteed my opening tag, which is auto-close-style 2
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq web-mode-enable-auto-closing t)
(setq-hook! web-mode web-mode-auto-close-style 2)
#+END_SRC
** Go
Go is enabled, with LSP support in our [[file:init.el][init.el]].  To get it working properly, though, you want to ensure you have all the go dependencies installed on your computer and your GOPATH set. It's recommended you read the doom docs on golang, following all links to ensure your dependencies are up to date.
[[file:~/humacs/doom-emacs/modules/lang/go/README.org][Go Docs]]

I've had inconsistencies with having the GOPATH set on humacs boxes, so if we are in a humacs pod, explicitly set the GOPATH
#+NAME: Set GOPATH on humacs boxes
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

#+END_SRC
** Vue
Tried out vue-mode, but it was causing more problems than benefits and doesn't seem to do much beyond what web-mode plus vue-lsp support would do.
So, following [[https://genehack.blog/2020/08/web-mode-eglot-vetur-vuejs-=-happy/][Gene Hack's Blog Post]], we'll create our own mode, that just inherits all of web-mode and adds lsp.
This requires for [[https://npmjs.com/vls][vls]] to be installed.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
